Project B will be a continuation of [Project A](/2018/06/11/project-1a-description).
In Project A, I created a virtual lab that would allow us to train our colleagues without risking production systems.
I made an asynchronous training process to allow a colleague to train at their own pace.
They learned how to manage AD users, AD groups, and network file shares.
The next step of this will be to create synchronous training for both remedial training and for training our part time technicians.

In this training, we will teach the basics of all of the components that were previously covered.
